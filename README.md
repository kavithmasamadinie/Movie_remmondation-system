## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. The system uses a dataset containing information about movies, including their genres, keywords, cast, and crew. By analyzing these features, the system can recommend movies that are similar to the ones the user has liked in the past.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset**, which contains information about 5000 movies, including their budget, genres, keywords, cast, crew, and more. The dataset is available in two CSV files:
- `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`
- `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`

These files contain detailed information about each movie, which is used to build the recommendation system.

## Installation
To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the dataset:**
   - Download the `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv` files from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).
   - Place the files in the `data` directory of the project.

## Usage
To use the movie recommendation system, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the `Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb` notebook.

2. **Execute the cells:**
   - The notebook contains code to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and build the recommendation system.
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to generate movie recommendations.

3. **Generate Recommendations:**
   - The system will recommend movies based on the input movie title. You can modify the code to customize the recommendations.

## Features
- **Content-Based Filtering:** The system recommends movies based on the similarity of their content (genres, keywords, cast, and crew).
- **Easy to Use:** The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to understand and modify.
- **Scalable:** The system can be extended to include more features or larger datasets.
